# PokéRandomizer Z-A

Bored? Randomize some Pokémon. Need a team? Let chance decide. Think you know Pokémon? Prove it.

## What's Inside

- **Randomizer**: Pick random Pokémon, moves, abilities, or items. Or go full chaos mode and randomize all at once
- **Team Builder**: Coming soon (basically randomizer v2 but with more structure)
- **Quiz**: "Who's That Pokémon?" - guess the silhouette, test your knowledge

## How It Works

**Pick a category** (Pokémon, moves, abilities, items) → **Choose a generation** (or go National Dex) → **Hit randomize** → Boom, you got your results

Filter by Gen 1-9 or just grab from everything. Want 1? 20? You decide. No duplicates in a single pull.

The dark theme with red Pokéball vibes looks clean, animations are smooth, works on your phone.

## What You See

- **Pokémon**: Dex number, sprite, types, all 6 stats with bars
- **Super Random**: Pokémon + random move + random ability + random held item (the full build)
- **Moves/Items/Abilities**: Name, description, relevant details

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Phosphor Icons

## Generations

Gen 1-9 + National Dex. Pick your era.

## Quick Start

1. Open `properPokeRandom_v4` in your browser
2. Pick Randomizer, Team Builder, or Quiz from the tabs
3. **Randomizer**: Pick a category → pick a gen → set how many → hit randomize
4. **Quiz**: See the silhouette → pick your answer → check if you were right

## To-Do

- [ ] Hook up real PokeAPI data
- [ ] Actual team builder with save/export
- [ ] More quiz difficulty options
- [ ] Better type filtering

## Real Quick

This is just a fun project. Currently has dummy data, but it's built to work with PokeAPI whenever.
