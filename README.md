# RandomPokeinator

Its a hobby project and bound to have errors. Do suggest any changes are bug fixes you come across.  

## What's Inside

- **Randomizer**: Pick random Pokémon, moves, abilities, or items. Or choose chaos mode and randomize all at once
- **Team Builder**: Just a fun team builder, not useful for competitive purposes. Visit Smogon for it. 
- **Quiz**: "Who's That Pokémon?" - guess the silhouette and see if you can find all the pokemon. All normal silhouttes, nothing is different angles or views. 

## How It Works

**Pick a category** (Pokémon, moves, abilities, items) → **Choose a generation** (or go National Dex) → **Hit randomize** → Boom, you got your results

Filter by Gen 1-9 or just grab from everything. Want 1? 20? You decide. No duplicates in a single pull.

## What You See

- **Pokémon**: Dex number, sprite, types, all 6 stats with bars
- **Super Random**: Pokémon + random move + random ability + random held item (the full build)
- **Moves/Items/Abilities**: Name, description, relevant details

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Phosphor Icons

## Generations

Gen 1-9 + National Dex. Pick your region.

## Quick Start

1. Pick Randomizer, Team Builder, or Quiz from the tabs
2. **Randomizer**: Pick a category → pick a gen → set how many → hit randomize
3. **Quiz**: See the silhouette → pick your answer → check if you were right

## Real Quick

This is nothing to do with Official Pokemon - not affiliated with Pokémon or The Pokémon Company, just a fun project of mine. All data are used from PokeAPI
